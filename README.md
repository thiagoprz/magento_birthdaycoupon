# Birthday Coupons On Magento
Adds birthday condition  to promotions in Magento store.

## Installation
Just put the app/ directory inside root folder of your Magento store (merge it).
Then refresh the cache for system and module files in Configuration > Cache.

## How it Works
The main goal is to allow the store owner to create promotions with discounts for birthdays. 
After the installation a new option will be prompted in Promotions > Shopping Cart Price Rules > Add New Rule > [Tab Conditions] Add New Condition.
This new option allows setting a coupon to birthday person, or even a not birthday person (maybe useless).
